  if the file is MPEG 1 Layer 3 then the first two bytes are 0xff 0xf0
  if the file is MPEG 2.5 then the first two bytes are 0xff 0xe0
  Thanks to Peter Taylor (pjt33b) for spotting this.

* AudioFile.ReadFirstFrame only needs to open the file for read
  thanks to gafman for a patch

* https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3205347&group_id=89188&atid=589317
  another incorrect FileShare.Write in AudioFile on line 108 which should also be FileShare.Read.
  Thanks again to Peter Taylor (pjt33b) 

* Use FileInfo.FullName not FileInfo.Name to create temp file in audio source file's directory 
  (as  originally intended), not process working directory.

  if (frameModel.Header.Version == 4) then frameSize = Sync.Unsafe(frameSize) and frameSize = Sync.Safe(frameSize);
  thanks to an anonymous benefactor

* Use new Memory.Extract instead of Memory.Copy

* Memory.GetBytes(ulong value) returns 8 bytes
  This is always suitable for Id3Lib.Frames.FramePlayCounter.Counter and Id3Lib.Frames.FramePopularimeter.Counter.
