Release: 0.6 - June/2012

Removed IFrame and now using FrameBase as the root, I did not see much benefit of having the interface as a mirror of the abstract base class.
I renamed several class from Frame to Tag to make it clear that they deal with the whole Tag not a specific frame.
These are braking changes but they can be fixed easily by renaming the classes.

Bug Fixes:

* Unicode stings that have characters ending in zero on some circumstances would be truncated and would mess the whole frame by shifting it one byte,
the bug was not setting the search position to the one desired and instead searching form the beginning of the byte array.

* Un-sync safe was not working properly, the un-synced stream requires to be rewound to the beginning of the file, this was not being done.

Release: 0.5 – 8/2011

Enhancements:

* all unsafe code removed, with much help from gafman
  
* solution and projects ported into VS2010; libraries use .Net 2.0, apps use .Net 3.5, ms tests have to use .Net 4.0

* Moved the exceptions and frames to different namespaces.

* Mp3FileData lazy-loaded to improve performance after updating a file

Bug Fixes:

* https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3205526&group_id=89188&atid=589317
  if the file is MPEG 1 Layer 3 then the first two bytes are 0xff 0xf0
  if the file is MPEG 2.5 then the first two bytes are 0xff 0xe0
  Thanks to Peter Taylor (pjt33b) for spotting this.

* AudioFile.ReadFirstFrame only needs to open the file for read
  thanks to gafman for a patch

* https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3205347&group_id=89188&atid=589317
  another incorrect FileShare.Write in AudioFile on line 108 which should also be FileShare.Read.
  Thanks again to Peter Taylor (pjt33b) 

* Use FileInfo.FullName not FileInfo.Name to create temp file in audio source file's directory 
  (as  originally intended), not process working directory.

  if (frameModel.Header.Version == 4) then frameSize = Sync.Unsafe(frameSize) and frameSize = Sync.Safe(frameSize);
  thanks to an anonymous benefactor

* Use new Memory.Extract instead of Memory.Copy

* Memory.GetBytes(ulong value) returns 8 bytes
  This is always suitable for Id3Lib.Frames.FramePlayCounter.Counter and Id3Lib.Frames.FramePopularimeter.Counter.
